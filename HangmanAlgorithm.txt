Create home screen: 2 buttons one for playing and other is for instructions
User clicked instructions: 
 Output instruction (Refer to prototype) 
 User clicked lets play 
  Three new buttons, level one, two, and three // levels just increase number of letters, overal program will stay the same 
  // have all words in an array, with each row a level, and each level has it's own column in the array of potential words for the hangman
  user clicks level 1: 
    Assign the array Word1 to hold the number of letters in the word "computer" // randomly chosen word based on array
    Assign each letter as a value in the array Word1 // ie Word1[1] = "o"
    output dashes as the placeholder for user inputs //number of values in the list is the amount of dashes 
    Create sprites for each letter in "computer" and place them ontop of the dashes 
    Hide the sprites
    create individual sprites for each part of the hangman 
    hide the sprite 
    create a while loop that will run untill user inputs stop 
        user input their guess (assign variable, UserGuess, for user input)
        perform try catch to validate if a proper letter was inputted, ie cannot be converted to double
        Create a for loop that will go through every value in the array Word1 and see if any letters match UserGuess. 
          if UserGuess matches a value in the list 
            unhide the sprite with the matched letter 
          else 
            unhide the sprite for hangman body part 
            output "try again"
            tell user that they need to get a math question right to continue
            go to the math method
  math method:
    create a while loop that will run until user gets answer correct
      randomly choose type of math problem (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, solve for x)
      generate the random integers
      create integer value mathAnswer, equal to the answer of the problem
      print out the question and ask the user for the answer
      in for loop that runs 3 times // they get 3 chances
        check if answer is valid integer
        if user's input is equal to mathAnswer
          ouput "correct" and exit the loop
        else
          output "incorrect and ask them to try again"
     output "try a different question"
